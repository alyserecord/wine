The vines were in perfect health.To the bracing acidity, concision and aromatic purity expected of the 2008 vintage, Dom Pérignon adds depth, density and complexity.

While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom Pérignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips—studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate.

It’s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision.

Cabernet Sauvignon 2016,750,0,"Renacido Vineyard is a dry farmed site in the Maule, and one that pushes the limits in terms of latitude for Cabernet Sauvignon. The Perquilauquen river is wide and shallow like a narrow lake and its water body lends the fruit cooler conditions. It is also very unusual for Chile because it flows from the Coastal Mountains East towards the Andes passing through Caliboro. Because of the strange flood plains created by a river that flows “backwards,” bridges have not been built on this section of the river and the locals must depend upon precarious “balsas,” small single car transporter commuter ferries with outboard motors. A certain disconnectedness follows and these communities are much more isolated and traditional then surrounding communities in the Maule (which are already quite isolated and traditional themselves). Fermented in an open top horizontal egg (think your normal concrete egg but sideways and without a lid). Much more savory “food-oriented” in comparison to the winery’s Maipo Cabernet Sauvignon bottling.

The grapes from this sloped and north-facing plot fermented with 30% full clusters and natural yeasts and matured in used barriques for eight to 11 months. If the nose is not as expressive as expected, it's the palate that should guide you through the real character of this wine, juicy and with fine tannins and a dry finish. I tasted from two bottles that showed similar character. I found it a little awkward, and I made a note to try to taste it again the next time I review the region.

The finish is long and persistent. It never really finishes, in fact, because just as it starts to, you’ll take another sip.Vintage Port needs to lie down during its years of slumber after it has been bottled. Keep it in a cool, dark, dry place, where it can rest in peace. At about 15 to 20 years old Vintage Port will start to show the characteristics of slow aging in the bottle and it will taste really exceptional. By then it will have gained silky elegance and complexity. But you can enjoy it earlier, if you prefer a more intense, fruity experience. It will go on for many years after that too.Vintage Port should be served in generous wine glasses, not the small thimble-like glasses in which most of the aromas and flavours are lost.

In the glass, the 2017 is richer, sweeter and more immediate than the much darker and more brooding 2016, with a distinct red fruit character. Best of all, it will drink well upon release. All things considered, Pax Mahle turned out a brilliant Syrah in 2017 and my guess is that less extreme vintages will provide an opportunity for him to match the 2016 – which, in my view, remains his best wine ever.

By the time I finished tasting this, the nose had exploded in this fragrant bomb of fruit, earth and floral notions. This is one of those 2018 wines that has a beguiling brightness that comes from the many floral, spice and mineral accents among all that rich fruit. WOW! Barrel Sample: 97-99', 'JD': ""A massive beast of a wine, the 2018 Palmer checks in as a blend of 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, and 7% Petit Verdot that comes from mildew decimated yields of 11 hectoliters per hectare. The vineyard manager commented that he had never seen conditions so favorable for mildew during the spring, and with the estate holding fast to their biodynamic viticulture, the result was a loss of over 70% of the normal production. Unsurprisingly, with barely any grapes to go around, no Alter Ego was produced. The 2018 reveals a saturated plum/purple color as well as a dense, full-bodied style that carries loads of plum, blackberry, and currant fruits as well as notes of scorched earth and graphite. The tiny yields certainly resulted in a massive, concentrated wine (it has the highest IPT ever recorded at the domaine), yet it lacks the purity and precision as well as weightless style of both the 2015 and 2016 at this point. Regardless, it's one thrilling, singular mouthful of a Palmer that has masses of ripe tannins, terrific balance, and a blockbuster finish. It's going to require upwards of a decade of bottle age and should live for just about forever.\n\nBarrel Sample: 95-97+"", 'JS': 'It is the essence of cabernet fruit with density that is so thick that it has the texture of grape puree.

In the 17th Century, during the reign of Louis XIV, France enjoyed its most illustrious era. Louis XIV became known as the ""Sun King"" for his benevolence and his patronage of the Arts, which became the foundation of France's rich artistic heritage. At the Palace of Versailles Louis XIV was the first French King to drink Champagne.Louis XIV's era became known as the Grand Siècle - the ""Great Century"". Bottled in a replica of a 17th Century bottle evoking the radiance of that period, Laurent-Perrier's prestige cuvées embody luxury, magnificence and elegance fit for a king.When it came to his prestige cuvée, Bernard de Nonancourt decided to highlight two of Champagne's traditional realms of proficiency: the blending of different crus and different vintages. Grand Siècle is the epitome of Champagne cuvées, as it blends complementary wines from Laurent-Perrier's very best growths and most successful vintage years.Grand Siècle is made with a pinot noir and chardonnay blend, with the latter being slightly dominant. Twelve of the most prestigious villages supply these grapes; all of them classified at 100% Grands Crus such as Ambonnay, Verzenay, Mailly, Avize, Cramant, Chouilly and Le Mesnil-sur-Oger. Within the vineyards of these villages, only the very best plots are selected, as are the finest musts from the pressings. The blended wine is then aged during the second fermentation on the yeast for approximately five years.It has a bright color, with a brilliant yellow hue. Its subtle aromas of honey, hazelnuts, grilled almonds and brioche, make this the perfect companion for refined dishes.

The bunches were hand-destemmed and the grapes fermented in open top vats with foot treading and soft pumping over. Malolactic fermentation was carried out in new French oak barriques where the wine matured for 18 months. I visited the Valmediano vineyard, at some 700 meters altitude; it is an ancient plot surrounded by pine trees where the main enemy are rabbits that eat all the leaves, grapes and branches from a handful of vines. The three vineyards are different and complement each other. What I liked about the 2012 was the sense of harmony and the subtlety to the aromas; everything is there, but nothing takes the leading role and the wine shows itself compact and as one, perfectly in synchronicity. There is something that made me think of Bordeaux here, perhaps that combination of energy, power and elegance. The palate is really balanced with ultra-refined tannins and a fine thread of acidity going through the core that is long and persistent. This wine is subtle, complex and elegant. This is the best wine I've ever tasted from Teso La Monja. As a reference, I tasted the 2010 that is also a superb vintage from Alabaster side by side with this, and there is one extra degree of depth and subtlety in this 2012. The 2010 is aging at glacial pace, and I don't see why the 2012 should age any faster, but it's approachable now and I think it should be pleasurable throughout its life.

Can be enjoyed now and has potential for aging.The first 21 acres of the Angela Vineyard were planted in 2006 with Pinot Noir clones 777, Wadenswil and 115. An additional 13 acres were planted in 2007, totaling 34 acres. Careful soil preparation, specifically designed to nourish the micro­organisms located at the layer 30 to 36 inches below ground (where topsoil meets mother rock) – creates the critical component which gives expression to Pinot Noir. Labor-intensive shoot positioning (hand-straightening and pinning of individual shoot) along with exact canopy management ensure that every leaf of the vine is photo-synthetically active.  Because of the uniqueness of the Savannah Ridge, the entire vineyard is usually harvested in one day.The Wadenswil clone dominantly planted on this vineyard produces Pinot Noir with incredible aromatics that exhibit rose petal, tea leaf and lavender top notes.

Traditionally, Marcoux's white is an unusual blend (in the sense that it was heavily Roussanne dominant) of 60% Roussanne and 40% Bourboulenc hailing from two parcels. The Roussanne's 0.5-hectares of vines in Les Esqueirons where the cool limestone-based soils are perfect for white grapes (bringing freshness, texture and finesse) and the Bourboulenc, a 0.35-hectare plot in Les Bosquets (this variety bringing more citric freshness and drive). From 2015, due to demand for this cuvée, Sophie Armenier has been vinifying and blending in Marcoux's white varieties that grow on their 'red' vineyards--Grenache Blanc and Clairette. Pre-2015 these grapes were co-fermented with the estate Châteauneuf-du-Pape rouge. Hence, the new blend looks something like this: Roussanne (55%; bringing the power), Bourboulenc (35%; freshness) and Grenache Blanc/Clairette (10%; flesh and finesse).

The chalky soils where the vineyards of Hacienda Monasterio are located have no difficulty making powerful wines but harnessing the terroir to make balanced wines requires a tremendous effort in the vineyard to match the yields to the vintage. In the cellar Peter has started employing increasingly higher proportions of stems, is moving towards a more gentle maceration and is employing more larger and more seasoned French oak barrels.  The Crianza, a blend of primarily Tempranillo with about 10-15% Cabernet Sauvignon and a smaller portion of Merlot, remains a rich wine but with a greater freshness and vibrancy. View More","{'JD': 'Made with guidance from Peter Sisseck, the 2015 Crianza from Hacienda Monasterio is a blockbuster effort that’s a blend of 75% Tinto Fino, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, and the balance Merlot, all of which spent 18 months in 30% new French oak. Its deep ruby/purple color is followed by terrific notes of blueberries, violets, graphite, and crushed rocks. Full-bodied, deep, concentrated, and elegant, with a traditional style and building tannin, it’s incredible that they produce upward of 30,000 cases of this beauty. It’s no doubt beautiful today yet will keep for a decade or more. Even at $50, it’s a smoking value!', 'RP': ""The flagship Crianza is now simply referred to as 2015 Hacienda Monasterio. This is their biggest production, with some 181,630 bottles in this classical and powerful vintage where the secret was an early harvest to keep the acidity and freshness in the wine and keep the alcoholic degree under control. It's mostly Tempranillo, with 10% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, fermented with indigenous yeasts and with long and soft macerations. It matured for some 18 months in French oak barrels, 25% of them new (a percentage that has been gradually lowered in the last few years). It has a balanced nose, with nuance and subtleness, with the oak nicely folded into the fruit, incipient perfume, and even if young, you can almost see where it can go in bottle. The foreign varieties are not really noticed; they are very integrated. The palate has terrific balance and refined tannins. There is no heat or excess ripening whatsoever. For a moment, I thought I was tasting the 2014. This is one of the best and most widely available wines from Ribera del Duero.

There’s a rawness to it that’s irresistibly compelling—piney, almost abrasive tannins, a feral scent of tanned leather and a more lifted violet scent. The fruit comes from a biodynamically farmed site on the cool southern edge of the Freestone-Occidental hills. In a warm year like 2014, those vines seemed to draw energy from the cooling wind and fog of the nearby Petaluma Gap, the fruit accumulating a dynamic pungency that transforms the wine into something completely delicious as it takes on air. The tannins soften, the layers of flavor become harmonious and supple. Eric Sussman’s hands-off winemaking—no additions other than sulfur—contribute to this wine’s sense of individuality; it feels more about site than generic “pinot noir” typicity, and will be a fascinating wine to watch over the next decade.', 'RP': 'The biodynamic vineyard that Sussman sources for the 2014 Pinot Noir Terra Neuma is a cold site as well with very low yields, The clonal selections here are limited to Dijon 155 and 777. This wine gets the same oak treatment as the La Neblina, and the result is a floral, almost Musigny grand cru-like Pinot Noir with a very Burgundian personality. Crushed rocks, spring flowers, raspberries and black cherries are all present in this wine, which has medium to full body, terrific fruit intensity, purity and overall texture.

The wine contains a substantial dollop of petit verdot (22%), adding a silky note of violets and textural elegance, in counterpoint to the lead-in-the-pencil firmness offered by the inclusion of the virile tannat (22%). Tannat, the grape implicated in the French paradox (and the vinifera variety with resveratrol levels that are off the charts), is principally grown in Gascony (land of Les Trois Mousquetaires), though it was historically grown as well in Bordeaux as late as the 19th century. Comparing this wine with the 2013 APC, the second vintage, the ’14 version is a bit plusher and posher, with softer tannins, not unreminiscent of the overstuffed chair at one’s Club.

These characteristics are clearly reflected in the 2014 Malbec Finca Altamira, which in any case is always the most floral and exuberant of the single-vineyard bottlings. What matters here is the origin, the soils and vines, rather than the process, which is kept more or less the same for all of the wines. It has a spectacular acid structure, not as creamy as other years, more vertical. Truly outstanding.

In warmer years, this is often focused on creaminess more than tannic structure. But in 2014, intense rains refreshed the vines, making for a juicy wine. The typical Malbec notes of black fruit and exotic spice are there, accompanied by penetrating acidity that draws out redder notes of sweet cherry and raspberry.

The stunning 2015 Solaia is solid evidence of this perfect alignment. This was a warm vintage that shows less favorably in my opinion in different parts of Italy and with other grapes that render their most elegant performances in the cooler vintages. I would put pure expressions of Nebbiolo and Sangiovese in this category. However, Tuscany and many of her great blended reds (made partially or fully with international grapes) operate according to a different logic. To me, their maximum expression comes when you can taste that Tuscan sunshine beaming from within. Its rays are brilliant and warm. They shine across the senses with opulence and intensity. The very name Solaia evokes the concept of sunshine and this unique Tuscan wine archetype I am referring to. With the 2015 vintage, Solaia is liquid sunshine not just in name but also in fact. The bouquet is immediately soft and sensual with dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco. The mouthfeel shows intensity and power, but you don't get any heavy residue from the dry extract (measured at 33 grams per liter). Indeed, the wine feels glossy, tonic and fresh. It is composed of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and a tiny part Cabernet Franc. There is a bit of crunch or snap that comes thanks to the more acidity-prone Sangiovese grape (the wine measures 3.5 in pH). Finally, the tannins are beautifully sweet and ripe. This wine is meticulously executed, and the 2015 vintage lives up to an ideal of what we imagine Solaia to be. It will be released about a week after this review is published."", 'JS': 'The nose to this Solaia is truly phenomenal with currants, blackberries, roses and violets. So perfumed.

Surprisingly fresh acidity for the hot vintage keeps it balanced. It still needs a few more years to fully develop. Cellar Selection', 'W&S': 'The 2015 Solaia is simply dazzling. While many regions of Tuscany suffered through heat and drought in the late summer, Solaia’s vines, situated between 1,150 and 1,325 feet in altitude, enjoyed cooler evening temperatures and some rain in August that stimulated the ripening process. The wine shows impressive freshness for the vintage, with high notes of menthol and licorice that balance the lush flavors of black currant and cassis. Other notes emerge—black olive, moist tobacco, dark chocolate, graphite—that build layers of complexity and concentration, even as the freshness persists.

/product/dumol-estate-pinot-noir-2015/391598,DuMOL Estate Pinot Noir 2015,750,0,"Brilliance in the glass. Cranberry, pomegranate, rhubarb and black raspberry fruit. Bay laurel, graphite and tarragon complexity. Underbrushy and woodsy, edgy and intriguing. Savory entry, red currant and sassafras, Rainier cherry and dark cassis. Broad across the palate, density and weight. Clove, lavender and forest floor. Balances succulence and structure. Youthful acidity and fresh minerals extend the finish. Slower to open. This one will age. Really fascinating, commanding pinot – a beautiful mix of red and black fruits, savory elements and chewy tannins. View More","{'RP': 'Medium ruby-purple in color, the 2015 Pinot Noir Estate Vineyard is beautifully scented of red roses, oolong tea, dusty soil and cinnamon stick with touches of cranberries, rhubarb and fungi. It displays incredible structure on the medium-bodied palate with very firm, very ripe tannins and an electric backbone of freshness supporting the densely packed perfumed red fruits, finishing with great length and depth.', 'JD': 'The 2015 Pinot Noir Estate Vineyard is a step up over the 2016 (splitting hairs) and offers slightly more depth and richness. Savory red and black fruits, scorched earth, and savory spices all give way to a medium to full-bodied, deep, rich, mineral-laced 2015 that has enough depth and structure to keep for a decade or more.'}"
/product/chateau-le-boscq-2016/520165,Chateau Le Boscq 2016,750,13.5,"Incredibly deep, and still almost black in appearance. The intense and complex bouquet imparts lovely fruit intensity to notes of cedar, spice and precious wood. The wonderfully supple palate gradually gains in intensity. Densely-packed, silky and very fine-grained tannic structure underpins generous richness on the palate, and is coated with spice and ripe fruit flavours. Smooth and concentrated, the wine culminates in a notably long, lingering finish, characterised by freshness and spice.Blend: 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot View More","{'JS': 'The aromas of spices, such as nutmeg and dried coriander, are very impressive. Black currants, too. Full-bodied with tannins that are fine-grained and very polished. Pretty finish that brings you back for more. Try in 2024.', 'RP': 'The 2016 Le Boscq, owned by Vignobles Dourthe, is a blend of 50% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot and was picked 29 September until 20 October. This represents a move towards Cabernet Sauvignon and away from Merlot in the final blend. It has a very ripe, opulent bouquet that does not quite convey its terroir with the same aplomb as say, the Phelan-Ségur. It translates more of the winemaking than the terroir. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red fruit, crisp acidity and quite an elegant finish. It is in the second half of this wine that the quality of the vintage shows through. Hopefully the aromatics will gain more composure and it will live up to the finish it currently displays. One to watch.\n\nBarrel Sample: 91-93', 'WE': 'This is a dense wine, packed with tannins. However this youthful concentration does not mask the bold black fruits and good acidity that are also very present. The vineyard surrounds a 19th-century chateau on a high point in Saint-Estèphe. Drink this intense wine from 2024.', 'D': 'This is an exceptional vintage for this property, owned by Dourthe Vignobles, who have produced a wine that is showing exceptionally well. It has extremely well controlled fruit extraction shot through with cinnamon and black pepper notes, some excellent tension and juicy fruit. Clearly an improvement on the 2015, and a great value pick. 50% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot.', 'JD': 'The 2016 Château Le Boscq a rock star of a Saint-Estephe and offers a concentrated, textured, perfectly balanced profile that’s very much in the style of the vintage. Liquid violets, mint, spring flowers, and blue fruit characteristics all emerge from this medium to full-bodied effort. It has present tannins, yet they’re integrated and polished, and it’s already accessible given its purity and, again, its balance. It should keep for 20 years or so.', 'WS': 'This is both winey, with currant and cherry paste flavors, as well as tangy, with bright iron minerality for spine and a lilac note flitting through. The taut finish has pebbly grip. Not big, but should be fun to watch this mellow slightly with time. Best from 2021 through 2031. 6,500 cases made.'}"

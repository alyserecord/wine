Imagine the scene in Casabasciana when, a few days after his ""funeral,"" Lorenzo Teldeschi came walking into town. A year later, he and his wife had their second son, Franco. The family eventually returned to California and Franco (who began calling himself Frank in America) planted his own vineyard and sold the grapes to Italian home winemakers in San Francisco. Sometime later, during the 1970s, a young winemaker came to their house in Dry Creek Valley and asked if he could buy grapes for his new winery, Ravenswood. He and Frank sat down under a tree and Frank opened a bottle of his homemade wine. Four hours later, Joel Peterson could hardly walk, but he had a deal for a few tons of Zinfandel.

Significant also has been the decision to include a rather larger proportion of mature Touriga Francesa and Touriga Nacional from Vila Velha, a classic riverside Quinta a short distance downstream from Malvedos, and some spectacular old vine lots from Vale de Malhadas in the Upper Douro. These wines each from family-owned Quintas have been used to reinforce the predominant component from Malvedos and the traditional excellence of the Rio Torto lots from Lages, to produce a rounded and even blend in the hallmark rich Graham style.Picking began at Malvedos on September 22nd and the last lagar was run off on October 10th, an unusually short and compact Vintage. Fruit arrived in good condition although yields were less than three quarters of a kilogram per vine, and the juice to skin ratio well below normal. 2000 was a year noted for a very low average yield across the Douro, and with the grapes unusually lacking in liquid, the extra amount of treading work required made it an ideal time to employ our new, tireless, mechanical treaders alongside the two original 1890 stone lagares still worked by human feet. It was evident early on in the Vintage from the colour and aroma of the fermenting musts that we were looking at a spectacular year, and after the usual waiting period of sixteen months or so to see how the lots would develop, we have now made our final selection and assembled the final blend.The blend displays many of the typical Graham aromas of ripe plum and 'esteva' (gum cistus) and is pleasantly smooth on the palate despite its youth. It is full and rich in the mouth with fresh blackberry and red plum notes. Despite the hallmark Graham sweetness in the mouth the finish is long and clean.As with all Graham Vintages, this is a wine made to last for years and the patience of laying down the wine for fifteen to twenty years will certainly be rewarded.

Pol Roger owns 200 acres of vineyards, which provide about 45% of their needs. Pol Roger's cellars extend over four miles of winding chalk passageways on two levels. The second or deeper cellar maintains a constant 9.5º C (50º F), one degree lower than the first level and most others in the region. This lower temperature slows the second fermentation, encouraging a finer mousse or bubbles. Pol Roger Champagne also spends two to three times the allowable minimum in the cellar before disgorgement, or about three years for the non-vintage and up to seven for the luxury cuvées. The long, slow maturation contributes greatly to the complex aromas, which distinguish these superb Champagnes.The Brut Non Vintage blend is traditionally composed from about 30 to 35 still base wines, drawn from different vineyard sites, grape varieties and vintage years. It usually contains wines of at least two vintages, often three or four. Reserve wines compose between 20-30% of the traditional blend.

The vibrant color of this wine is almost startling, and the clarity of the dark, black-violet liquid draws the eye toward the glass.

Fine, even and lively sparkle. Complex and intense bouquet disclosing candied citrus, yellow fruit, Williams pear, pollen, and toasted almond. The delicately seductive bouquet shows intensity and well-honed precision. The wine is powerful, full yet tight, on entry to the palate. The 2008 vintage is undeniably well structured but in a particular way: the wine’s almost saline concentration has not been created by the sun but is derived from the dryness of the chalk soil in a particularly cool summer. The result is a smooth, almost liquorous, mouthfeel that coats the palate with a powerful yet soft texture. This gives way to an incredible finish, underpinned by freshness and an impression of absolute purity with a taut and very saline character. The Cristal 2008 is deep, intense and masterful. It offers the quintessential reflection of its chalk soils which lend it is velvety texture and delicate tension. This wine’s energy has been tamed by an unusually long period of bottle ageing: Cristal 2008 was in fact aged for 10 years before its release on the market. A first!

Today, Pinot Noir vines occupy seven acres of the estate vineyard and typically yield a meager one to one-and-a-half tons per acre.

The entry of this dense Petite is both tannic and bold while maintaining a juicy, overripe profile displaying ample acidity to balance the tannins and fruit concentration making it multidimensional and food friendly. The finish is so supple and smooth that you will miss it when it is gone.
The grapes for this wine come from Wilson Farms, a 3rd generation farm established in 1922. While their first grapes were planted to other varietals it became understood rather quickly that the best two varietals to grow there are both Chenin Blanc and Petite Sirah. The planting we first started making wine from was 1978, but we have diversified into other blocks which allows us to make a more complex wine and achieve maximum color extraction. Part of what makes Clarksburg a special appellation is the cooling trend that comes in from the San Francisco Bay everyday at about 3:30 pm which sweeps the heat out of the valley floor and allows the grapes to maintain their natural acidity. I like to say this is a reverse cooling trend in that moderation (of heat) comes in the afternoon rather than the early mornings as it does on the coast. View More"

This aging process certainly contributes to Altero’s forward nose and enveloping mouth-feel. Starting with the 1995 vintage, the aging period in wood required for Brunello was reduced to two years. Because from the very first vintage Altero had always conformed to these new requirements (and all the others), it automatically gained the status of Brunello di Montalcino.

Dan has chosen to use three to consider for this special offering: the mixed block of Pommard and 2A, which produces deep, dark and chewy wine (there’s always something special about mixed clone fermentations); the 667 block, which adds focus and precise berry fruit; and the 828 block, providing ebullient freshness and solid structure.Aromas of raspberry blossoms and a basket of summer berries and cherries lead the wine. Notes of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg add their spicy/savory accent to the sweet berries, giving the wine an added layer of interest. The bright summer pie theme continues in the mouth, with black raspberries riding on a satiny texture of plush tannins. A dusky sandalwood spice chimes in on the lengthy finish.

The Bokisch Vista Luna Vineyard sits in the Borden Ranch AVA, on a mound of quartz in western Calaveras County, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Range. The site is exceptional for the hard, rocky soil – largely quartz – brought to the surface from a mile or more below when the mountain range was formed. Moreover, while the area is normally thought of as a warm appendage to the Central Valley, a wind phenomenon known as the Sierra Rotor is constantly bringing in cooler ocean air through the Golden Gate, effectively lowering the ambient temperature several degrees. The parcel is planted to an heirloom selection of Zinfandel that is small clustered and as a result ripens evenly, even when harvested at 23° Brix. We are thus able to keep the natural alcohol level around 14% in most vintages, yet still have bright, fresh flavors. The rest of the blend comes from the Fanthom Vineyard in the Mokelumne River AVA in Lodi from vines that are over 40 years old and produce concentrated, robust Zinfandel. Here’s a wine that will charm even the most demanding Zinfandel enthusiast. The wine spends about 10 months in neutral French oak barrels, then is bottled without either fining or filtration in the summer following the harvest. It’s sturdy, rustic, and loaded with flavor View More"

But it also has the elegance of age: the softness and smoothness that can only be achieved by slow ageing in old oak barrels.

We are not claiming that Novellum is like these auspicious wines but we will argue that for its price you can hardly find better. For many years we worked with a cooperative in the Languedoc to make Novellum from aspecial site that in most years had some botrytis, giving the wine weight without resorting to oak. Since that time we’ve moved the project to the Roussillon where Jean-Marc and Eliane Lafage have some Chardonnay planted near the Mediterranean that makes a remarkably complex and mineral version of the variety. There is no botrytis here so we resort to a small percentage in barrel – usually less than 20%. The remainder of the wine is aged in tank on the lees of Viognier. It remains one of the best values in Chardonnay that you can find. View More"

These vineyards produced tiny yields, just 630g/vine. The structure and complexity of the old vines was balanced with great acidity and freshness from the Cavadinha grapes and the superb floral aromatics from the two Touriga varieties harvested at Quinta da Telhada. Due to the very cool nights during the vintage, the grapes arrived at the Cavadinha lagar winery so cold in the mornings that, in effect, they had a ‘cold soak maceration’ before fermentation began, favouring excellent aromatic extraction.

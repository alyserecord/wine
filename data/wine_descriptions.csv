The 2016 Chappellet Signature Cabernet is again one of the top players in the Napa Valley. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits the pinnacle of power and balance. Its aromas and flavors of luscious black fruit, subtle oak accents, and savory spices make it a perfect pair mate with a juicy ribeye and a dab of a triple crème blue-veined cheese.

The mouthfeel is thinner and more streamlined, but this is in large part intentional. I have written about this in the past: This celebrated Italian white has experienced a restyling effort to lighten and brighten it up. Harvest is executed a bit earlier in order to limit alcohol. The percentage of Grechetto was reduced to make more room for the freshness and natural acidity that comes from the increased Chardonnay component. Lastly, skin maceration times were tweaked and reduced from about eight hours in past vintages to four to six hours (at cooler temperatures) in this vintage. All of these changes work to reverse the textural heaviness and fruit maturity that, to many, feels out of date in today's wine market. The results are clear. This is a pristine and elegant interpretation with crisp notes of peach and tropical fruit followed by sharp mineral definition. Those salty flavors come from the Grechetto. The wine ferments and stays in oak for five months. This is a classic vintage that has produced a profoundly vertical and focused wine. I'm told that great efforts have been made to recreate this magic formula in 2017, despite the fact that vintage is much hotter and drier.

In the 17th Century, during the reign of Louis XIV, France enjoyed its most illustrious era. Louis XIV became known as the ""Sun King"" for his benevolence and his patronage of the Arts, which became the foundation of France's rich artistic heritage. At the Palace of Versailles Louis XIV was the first French King to drink Champagne.Louis XIV's era became known as the Grand Siècle - the ""Great Century"". Bottled in a replica of a 17th Century bottle evoking the radiance of that period, Laurent-Perrier's prestige cuvées embody luxury, magnificence and elegance fit for a king.When it came to his prestige cuvée, Bernard de Nonancourt decided to highlight two of Champagne's traditional realms of proficiency: the blending of different crus and different vintages. Grand Siècle is the epitome of Champagne cuvées, as it blends complementary wines from Laurent-Perrier's very best growths and most successful vintage years.Grand Siècle is made with a pinot noir and chardonnay blend, with the latter being slightly dominant. Twelve of the most prestigious villages supply these grapes; all of them classified at 100% Grands Crus such as Ambonnay, Verzenay, Mailly, Avize, Cramant, Chouilly and Le Mesnil-sur-Oger. Within the vineyards of these villages, only the very best plots are selected, as are the finest musts from the pressings. The blended wine is then aged during the second fermentation on the yeast for approximately five years.It has a bright color, with a brilliant yellow hue. Its subtle aromas of honey, hazelnuts, grilled almonds and brioche, make this the perfect companion for refined dishes.

At the base of the Palisades in the Stags Leap District, he discovered the property he’d dreamed of: The hillside, with its thin, volcanic soils, would serve as the sort of vineyard site he knew had been prized in the Mediterranean for centuries. In 1978, he produced the first Shafer Vineyards wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from his original block of hillside vines. That debut expression was released in 1981 to high praise, setting a benchmark for future Shafer Hillside Cabernets like this one.

/product/grahams-vintage-port-2000/53899,Graham's Vintage Port 2000,750,0,"It is with great pleasure that Graham's announces the declaration of the 2000 Vintage, a wine that has been deemed to meet our very exacting standards, and one that shows every promise of living up to the reputation of the very best Vintage ports that the Twentieth Century provided.This is a landmark wine for Graham's, not only being the first Vintage of a new millennium, but being the first Vintage wine to enjoy the extraordinary results achieved by the new robotic 'lagares' at Malvedos in the inaugural year of our remodelled winery. Significant also has been the decision to include a rather larger proportion of mature Touriga Francesa and Touriga Nacional from Vila Velha, a classic riverside Quinta a short distance downstream from Malvedos, and some spectacular old vine lots from Vale de Malhadas in the Upper Douro. These wines each from family-owned Quintas have been used to reinforce the predominant component from Malvedos and the traditional excellence of the Rio Torto lots from Lages, to produce a rounded and even blend in the hallmark rich Graham style.Picking began at Malvedos on September 22nd and the last lagar was run off on October 10th, an unusually short and compact Vintage. Fruit arrived in good condition although yields were less than three quarters of a kilogram per vine, and the juice to skin ratio well below normal. 2000 was a year noted for a very low average yield across the Douro, and with the grapes unusually lacking in liquid, the extra amount of treading work required made it an ideal time to employ our new, tireless, mechanical treaders alongside the two original 1890 stone lagares still worked by human feet. It was evident early on in the Vintage from the colour and aroma of the fermenting musts that we were looking at a spectacular year, and after the usual waiting period of sixteen months or so to see how the lots would develop, we have now made our final selection and assembled the final blend.The blend displays many of the typical Graham aromas of ripe plum and 'esteva' (gum cistus) and is pleasantly smooth on the palate despite its youth. It is full and rich in the mouth with fresh blackberry and red plum notes. Despite the hallmark Graham sweetness in the mouth the finish is long and clean.As with all Graham Vintages, this is a wine made to last for years and the patience of laying down the wine for fifteen to twenty years will certainly be rewarded.

Best after 2014."", 'JS': 'Aromas of dried fruits, raisins and Christmas cake. Some chocolate undertones too, plus licorice and wet earth.

The second or deeper cellar maintains a constant 9.5º C (50º F), one degree lower than the first level and most others in the region. This lower temperature slows the second fermentation, encouraging a finer mousse or bubbles. Pol Roger Champagne also spends two to three times the allowable minimum in the cellar before disgorgement, or about three years for the non-vintage and up to seven for the luxury cuvées. The long, slow maturation contributes greatly to the complex aromas, which distinguish these superb Champagnes.The Brut Non Vintage blend is traditionally composed from about 30 to 35 still base wines, drawn from different vineyard sites, grape varieties and vintage years. It usually contains wines of at least two vintages, often three or four. Reserve wines compose between 20-30% of the traditional blend.

It was created in 1876 and is composed of Grand Crus from the Montagne de Reims, the Marne Valley, and the Côte des Blancs. Cristal 2008 was bottle-aged for 8 years before being left to rest for at least 8 months after disgorging in order to attain perfect maturity.Amber hue with green and orange tints. Fine, even and lively sparkle. Complex and intense bouquet disclosing candied citrus, yellow fruit, Williams pear, pollen, and toasted almond. The delicately seductive bouquet shows intensity and well-honed precision. The wine is powerful, full yet tight, on entry to the palate. The 2008 vintage is undeniably well structured but in a particular way: the wine’s almost saline concentration has not been created by the sun but is derived from the dryness of the chalk soil in a particularly cool summer. The result is a smooth, almost liquorous, mouthfeel that coats the palate with a powerful yet soft texture. This gives way to an incredible finish, underpinned by freshness and an impression of absolute purity with a taut and very saline character. The Cristal 2008 is deep, intense and masterful. It offers the quintessential reflection of its chalk soils which lend it is velvety texture and delicate tension. This wine’s energy has been tamed by an unusually long period of bottle ageing: Cristal 2008 was in fact aged for 10 years before its release on the market. A first!

The colour is a stylish pale gold flecked with green. Aromas of white flowers are joined by a cleansing citrus vigour and richer tones of peach and mirabelle. The palate is still quiet, but a tender creaminnes shows through, and there's so much concentration to come if you drink if after 2021. The greatness of the wine owes everything to the influence of organic and biodynamic precepts in the field - and Lecaillon's sleepless perfectionism in the cellar towards finer fruit and a careful brake on too much yeasty expression.

I think vinification and élevage is now a secondary consideration for these Mas Alta wines because what I have in the glass is much more about the place, which to me makes the wine much more interesting. This is balsamic with notes hinting on camphor, but mainly rosemary, fennel and thyme with even a floral touch and a mixture of black and red berries and some spiciness thrown in.

The logistics of doing this volume is not easy, and in 2016 they were able to ferment 100% of the volume in their own winery, which gave them more control. The year was naturally fresher, mostly through higher yields, and they also managed the harvest date with more precision. All this translates into a fresher wine with more precision and elegance.

Firm pear and apple fruit flavors are balanced with luminous minerality and a subtle framing of creamy vanilla toast. The grapes were whole-cluster pressed immediately after harvest to minimize phenolic extraction, thus preserving the most pure expression of the fruit. The juice was cold settled, racked, and inoculated at 55 degrees with Maurivin Elegance, a cool fermenting yeast that promotes the fragrant and fruity aromas inherent in La Ribera Chardonnay. 33% of the wine was fermented and sur lie aged for 6 months with the balance in stainless steel.

The budwood came from Paul Masson’s original vineyard near Mount Eden.

The faith Ray demonstrated in this difficult red wine variety, at a time when America had little appreciation of fine wine, was remarkable. Today, Pinot Noir vines occupy seven acres of the estate vineyard and typically yield a meager one to one-and-a-half tons per acre.

The grapes for this wine come from Wilson Farms, a 3rd generation farm established in 1922. While their first grapes were planted to other varietals it became understood rather quickly that the best two varietals to grow there are both Chenin Blanc and Petite Sirah. The planting we first started making wine from was 1978, but we have diversified into other blocks which allows us to make a more complex wine and achieve maximum color extraction. Part of what makes Clarksburg a special appellation is the cooling trend that comes in from the San Francisco Bay everyday at about 3:30 pm which sweeps the heat out of the valley floor and allows the grapes to maintain their natural acidity. I like to say this is a reverse cooling trend in that moderation (of heat) comes in the afternoon rather than the early mornings as it does on the coast.

These early season rains replenished the vineyards to begin a near-ideal growing season. After a warm spring led to an early budbreak, summer seemed to arrive quickly on the Central Coast. While we had abundant warmth in July and August, cool evenings allowed the grapes to mature perfectly, and harvest commenced in mid-August. While the grapes were small and dense, good-sized clusters delivered yields close to our annual averages. As a result, our 2016 Pinot Noirs are beautifully balanced, yet intense, while our Chardonnays are bright, crisp and flavorful.  Crafted using grapes from a handful of the finest vineyards on the Central Coast, this alluring wine offers lovely aromatics, soft, velvety tannins, and vibrant fruit. On the palate, layers of Bing cherry, wild strawberry, and sassafras are underscored by hints of white pepper and baking spices that add nuance and complexity to a long, lush finish.

Since then, I have always been on the lookout for these wines. The 2016 Calera Pinot Noir, though not a single vineyard, is emblematic of how special Josh's work has been. TASTING NOTES: This wine is flavorful and balanced. Its aromas and flavors of pure red fruit, savory spices, and brown stems are the real things when it comes to this grape variety. Pair it with a crown roast of lamb and enjoy. (Tasted: October 17, 2018, San Francisco, CA)""}"

It was a prolific vintage, so they had to do a severe green harvest to adjust yields, and some rains in September forced the harvest to be a little earlier. The final blend is slightly different each year and in 2014 it was 70% Tempranillo, 17% Syrah and 13% Cabernet Sauvignon. The aging in barrel was slightly shorter, 11 months instead of 13. 2014 was a homogeneous vintage and they didn't need to use any Merlot, which in slightly warmer vintages does not work as nicely as in cooler ones. This wine changed from the 2010 vintage, as before that year they used quite a lot of oak and the wine was very oaky. They have now removed the excess, and the wines show more precision and purity.

So Louis Roederer offered him an exceptional crystal bottle, holding the fruit of vines selected from the seven great crus on his estate. The Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes provide the subtle, precise balance that has now become synonymous with the leading prestige cuvée of Champagne.A yellow-gold color with mat and amber tints. Persistent, brilliant, fine and lively bubbles. A subtle bouquet, simultaneously discreet and concentrated. It releases notes of citrus compote and candied apricots and evokes the sweetness of honeysuckle. When aerated, notes of vanilla-edged cocoa bean emerge, with toasted hazelnut, hints of liquorice and even a touch of cinnamon. The palate is structured, energetic and sculpted. An initial dense, ripe and silky sensation is amplified by the discovery of a chalky, cherry freshness, a powdered, almost mentholated brightness. The feeling is delicate and ethereal, a succession of delicious and colorful textures perfectly integrated within the lightness and finesse of the wine... an invitation on a journey of discovery. The bright personality of Cristal then appears, simultaneously pure and sharp, in a finish focused once again on chalk, energy and grain.

I liked them both a lot, but I\'d pick this if I had to choose today, a minor preference, which makes this an even better value than the White Springs single-vineyard wine this issue. Perhaps not quite as concentrated and not quite as age-worthy, this is still pretty close. It does everything beautifully, and then adds that extra touch of fruit. I won\'t be surprised if the answer is different in a few years in comparing the two—in fact, I suspect it will be—but the balance here is very good.

The winery said this was intentionally left a bit smoky on the nose during fermentation and via lees' aging to support the fullness of fruit. \nIt's steely and focused with precision that belies its category, yet there is also fine fruit to go with the mouthwatering finish. I'm a little warier of that smoky nuance, not my favorite aromatic characteristic, but it seemed minor even on opening to the point where I had to think about it. The next day, that was insignificant, and hopefully it stays that way. More importantly, the wine also blossomed in general. Actually, it exploded. It showed a crisper edge but a much better expression of fruit as well. It seems full in the mouth, intense and perfectly balanced. While it may not be quite as deep as a couple of the upper-level Rieslings from Red Newt this issue, it holds its own surprisingly well.\nOverall, this is a beauty. It may age extremely well if well stored. Give it a year or two in the cellar if you can so that it fulfills its promise better.

The estate-grown fruit sends up gamy scents that conjure dreams of blood sausage and lead down a deep, dark entryway into a core of blue plum, black cherry and cassis fruits.

It comes in at 13% alcohol. Sourced entirely from Yianakohori, Naoussa, this is traditional in all senses of the word. It is the familiar style of Xinomavro—a little earthy, rustic and crisp—that makes me compare it to old-school Nebbiolo. True, not everyone holds to that style, including Kir-Yianni with its Diaporos bottling this issue. This is iconic, though. It is pretty tight right now, a bit too dusty. Yet, with about two hours of air, it comes around surprisingly well. (That\'s not always the case!) For all of the power, the amber and freshness, there is also a certain lushness and fine fruit. This will still benefit greatly from about three more years or so in the cellar. Or, you can take it to your BYOB pizza shop tonight, serve it blind and watch the guys from the old country go: ""I love Nebbiolo!""'}"

The oldest petite sirah vines on our Lytton Estate were planted in 1901 and the youngest in 2008. We made our first wine from the property in 1972 and until 2002 when we bottled portions of the petite sirah as a separate wine for a limited release, it had always been included in the Lytton Springs Zinfandel.

In 2001, Steve planted its perfectly drained Gold Ridge sandy loam soil to several Pinot clonal blocks. Dan has chosen to use three to consider for this special offering: the mixed block of Pommard and 2A, which produces deep, dark and chewy wine (there’s always something special about mixed clone fermentations); the 667 block, which adds focus and precise berry fruit; and the 828 block, providing ebullient freshness and solid structure.Aromas of raspberry blossoms and a basket of summer berries and cherries lead the wine. Notes of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg add their spicy/savory accent to the sweet berries, giving the wine an added layer of interest. The bright summer pie theme continues in the mouth, with black raspberries riding on a satiny texture of plush tannins. A dusky sandalwood spice chimes in on the lengthy finish.

The vastexperience of the new team meant that we were more than up to the challenges of the season'scool conditions. Yes, we all had to work harder, but we can take pride in the results: wines ofgreat charm. The mountain tannins of 2011 are smoother than most vintages, giving thewine structure with velvety texture and suppleness even in its youth. View More","{'W&S': 'Rainy and unseasonably cold, the 2011 vintage wasn’t a year for beginners, but for better or worse it was Bettina Sichel’s first vintage at Laurel Glen, after she purchased the property from Patrick Campbell. In March of that year she brought in Phil Coturri to manage the vineyard, which he began cultivating organically while dialing back the irrigation. The vineyard, perched on a saddle of volcanic soil above the fog line yet sheltered from the coastal wind, did manage to fully ripen, just later than normal. The final grapes were harvested on November 1. Sonoma Mountain is one of California’s cooler areas for cabernet, so you might be surprised at how expansive this wine feels. Made by Randall Watkins, with input from David Ramey, this is tight with mineral tannins and flashes of minty black-currant tang. With a day of air, the tannins turn more supple and the floodgates open into a clean line of cassis flavor that’s driven by fresh acidity, energizing a wine with the lilting complexity of a string quartet, scents of violet and Christmas spices and bay-infused meat stock intertwining in a finish that goes on for minutes. Give this ten years in the cellar; it’s a classical mountain cabernet with a profound structural integrity, build to last.'}"

The Bokisch Vista Luna Vineyard sits in the Borden Ranch AVA, on a mound of quartz in western Calaveras County, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Range. The site is exceptional for the hard, rocky soil – largely quartz – brought to the surface from a mile or more below when the mountain range was formed. Moreover, while the area is normally thought of as a warm appendage to the Central Valley, a wind phenomenon known as the Sierra Rotor is constantly bringing in cooler ocean air through the Golden Gate, effectively lowering the ambient temperature several degrees. The parcel is planted to an heirloom selection of Zinfandel that is small clustered and as a result ripens evenly, even when harvested at 23° Brix. We are thus able to keep the natural alcohol level around 14% in most vintages, yet still have bright, fresh flavors. The rest of the blend comes from the Fanthom Vineyard in the Mokelumne River AVA in Lodi from vines that are over 40 years old and produce concentrated, robust Zinfandel. Here’s a wine that will charm even the most demanding Zinfandel enthusiast. The wine spends about 10 months in neutral French oak barrels, then is bottled without either fining or filtration in the summer following the harvest.

There are quince trees in the estate and they give the name to the wine (membrillo is the Spanish word for quince). This is a plot bordering Altamira that was planted with Cabernet when they bought it. They have now also planted Malbec and Cabernet Franc, so this wine will change in the future. They won't bottle the 2014 and 2015 vintages that were not good years for Cabernet in Mendoza. It's not easy to detect the grape here anyway. I see more similarities with the Canal Uco bottling to which Sebastian Zuccardi responded that the soils are very similar. The wine has very good freshness with fine tannins coating a fine thread of lively acidity. They have four different types of soils here and they used three for this wine. When the soils are very shallow the Cabernet has a tendency to dry out and the tannins can feel a bit harsh, so they need to find good balance using deeper soils to obtain these buttery tannins with the variety. The oak is a lot more noticeable since they use more new oak with the Cabernet than with Malbec. It has classic aromas of the oak-aged Cabernet, quite different from the Malbecs, mint, damsons, blackberries, something earthy, graphite even, cigar box and spices, and with the telltale tannins of the variety where the earthiness is more pronounced.

In my view, this is the finest Figeac ever produced. Barrel Sample: 97-99', 'JD': 'Tasting like a hypothetical blend of the 2015 and 2016, the 2018 Château Figeac offers that rare mix of elegance and sexiness that makes it the most Médoc-like wine from the Right Bank. Checking in as a blend of 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc that will spend 19 months in new oak, made from 75% of the total production, it offers a saturated purple color as well as incredible notes of liquid violets, exotic flowers, crème de cassis, and spice box. Full-bodied, multi-dimensional, flawlessly balanced, and with awesome purity of fruit, it’s going to flirt with perfection in 4-5 years and keep for 3-4 decades or more. Hats off to director Frédéric Faye for another viscerally thrilling wine that’s up with the crème de la crème of the vintage. Barrel Sample: 97-99.', 'V': ""The 2018 Figeac is simply magnificent. A regal, soaring wine with tremendous vertical lift and nuance, the 2018 is marvelously complete from the very first taste. All the elements fall into place effortlessly. Medium in body and refined, the 2018 is vibrant, with fine tannins and, frankly, quite a bit more freshness than I expected to see given the very dry, sunny summer. Rose petal, mint, lavender and spice add nuance to a core of red/purplish fruit. Harvest started on September 17 and finished on October 12. Yields were 39 hectoliters per hectare, just shy of the historical average of 42/32. While mildew pressure was an issue, it was the dry October winds and their dehydrating effect on the last Cabernets that impacted yields most. Like so many of his colleagues, Technical Director Frederic Faye and his team opted for gentler vinifications with no SO2 at crush, lower temperatures in fermentation and smaller pumpovers. The 2018 Figeac is brilliant. That's all there is to it. The blend is 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc. Tasted three times.\nBarrel Sample: 96-99"", 'D': ""Back to a more traditional blend after last year's frost impact, Figeac has done a wonderful job of harnessing the opulence of the vintage while maintaining freshness. This is extremely focussed and precise, with a silky texture and inky depths, developing complexity as the flavours unfurl. These are big tannins but they steal up on you, doing that subtle creep that's such a marker of the vintage. Powerful, utterly gorgeous and clearly a wine that will age well, this is equal to the estate's excellent 2016.  Barrel Sample: 98""}"

We are not claiming that Novellum is like these auspicious wines but we will argue that for its price you can hardly find better. For many years we worked with a cooperative in the Languedoc to make Novellum from aspecial site that in most years had some botrytis, giving the wine weight without resorting to oak. Since that time we’ve moved the project to the Roussillon where Jean-Marc and Eliane Lafage have some Chardonnay planted near the Mediterranean that makes a remarkably complex and mineral version of the variety. There is no botrytis here so we resort to a small percentage in barrel – usually less than 20%. The remainder of the wine is aged in tank on the lees of Viognier.

Wiemer Late Harvest Riesling 2016,750,0,"This enticing Riesling is crafted in the traditional German Spätlese style, with moderate natural sweetness counterpoised by a bright, invigorating liveliness. In a yearly gamble against the weather, grapes for Spätlese wines are left to hang for a longer time on the vines, allowing them to develop riper flavor profiles. The later picking also increases must weight resulting in a more full-bodied wine. Spätlese wines have a greater intensity and strength than Kabinett-style wines, though are still the lightest of the late harvest wines. The outcome is a wine with an elegant yet luscious nose, followed by a generous palate of crisp ripe fruit and floral notes, lingering into a long, naturally sweet finish.

This adds a layer of concentration and a hit of sugar to the Semi-Dry this issue, but it is not overly sugary. It's not a typical table wine at this point, but it's not as far off as the statistics might suggest. With some age, as the sugar blows off, it might pass for a table wine. It is very elegant and nicely balanced this year, not a hair out of place. It doesn't seem quite as intense as some recent years, but it is still very fine.
